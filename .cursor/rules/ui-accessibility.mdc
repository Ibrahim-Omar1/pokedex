# UI & Accessibility

- Use Tailwind classes for all styling; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
- Use shadcn/ui for UI primitives and accessible components.
- Implement accessibility features: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, roles, and color contrast.
- Use responsive design with Tailwind's mobile-first approach.
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting and lazy loading non-critical components.
