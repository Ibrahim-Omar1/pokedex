# Data & State Management

- Use React Server Components and Next.js SSR features where possible.
- Minimize `use client`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor derived state and memoization.
- Use Zod for schema validation and type inference.
- Use TanStack React Query for data fetching and caching if needed.
- Use Zustand for state management if global state is required.
