# Code Style & Implementation

- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Use named exports for components and functions.
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Use early returns and guard clauses for error handling.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable and function names (e.g., `isLoading`, `handleClick`).
- Use the RORO (Receive an Object, Return an Object) pattern for functions with many parameters.
- Place static content and interfaces at the end of files.
