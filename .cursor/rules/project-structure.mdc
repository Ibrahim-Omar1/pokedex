# Project Structure Guide

- All source code is under `src/`.
- Routing, layouts, and pages are in `src/app/` (Next.js App Router).
- UI primitives and design system components are in `src/components/ui/` (powered by shadcn/ui).
- Feature-specific components are in `src/components/features/`.
- Custom React hooks are in `src/hooks/`.
- Utilities and API clients are in `src/lib/`.
- TypeScript type definitions are in `src/types/`.
- React context providers are in `src/context/`.
- All styling is handled by Tailwind CSS; no separate styles directory is needed.
- Global styles are managed via Tailwind's config and `globals.css` in `app/layout.tsx`.
